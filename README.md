# PathriseProject02

Pathrise is an online program that provides 1-on-1 guidance, training and counseling to help job seekers land the best possible careers in technology.
Every two weeks, Patrice welcomes a new group of companions. 
If a candidate is interested in joining our program and successfully completes all stages of our admissions process, they will receive an offer to join Pathris and become an Associate.
Being able to predict how quickly each individual will find a job is critical to our business.
In this project, I used a method for pre-processing data and in project number 01, I used another method for pre-processing,
and in both of them I tried 3 models and 2 ways to predict.
